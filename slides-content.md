# Dual Use I

<blockquote> 
 …goods, software and technology that can be used for both civilian and military applications and/or can contribute to the proliferation of WMDs…
  </blockquote> 
<cite>European Commission, [15]</cite>

Note:
* what is civil, what is military? where/what is police work? if police is civil, then there are lots of technologies with harmful intents.
* what constitutes a  weapons of mass destruction (WMD) -- are the ADIs WMDs? [11]

---

# Dual Use II

<blockquote> 
  for military or other purposes with non-peaceful intents (…) like artificial intelligence and genetics which can be easily weaponised
</blockquote>
  <cite>Datta Burton et al. PPT, p. 5</cite>
  
---

# Dual Use III

<blockquote> 
 does your research affect current standards in military ethics? Does your research involve the development of technologies or the creation of information that could have severe negative impacts on human rights standards (e.g. privacy, stigmatization, discrimination), if misapplied?
</blockquote>
  <cite>Datta Burton et al. PPT, p. 23: 2014 version of checklist</cite>

Note:
* ethics checklist on DU is a requirement only for researchers who want their project to be funded by the EU?
* it's all about the trade-offs -- economy vs. personal security, surveillance, privacy, human rights, ...
* see also discussion about China having an advantage because they don't care about ethics "as much as Europe does" (which IMO is not much to begin with)

# Autonomous Drone Insects (ADIs)

put something about public use here
pollination
honey bee-replacement

---

## ADIs - Second use

funded by government in exchange for backdoor

---

## ADIs - Backdoor Problems

Turns out: wenns eine offizielle backdoor gibt, kann die auch von Dritten missbraucht werden

## Introduction: the plot

menschen werden durch einzelne bienen umgebracht, aber noch unklar, wie

---

## ADIs - Image Recognition

anderes "tolles" dual-use example
side-rant über face-recognition

---

## ADIs - 3D Printing

self-reproducing devices

ebenfalls dual-use, weil sowohl in civil als auch military contexts nutzbar

---

# plot - target selection

via pseudo twitter

---

# Exkurs: cyber bullying

not part of the papers, but kinda relevant here

---

# that big-ass database

intro. spieltnur als großes telefonbuch eine rolle, hat aber auch großes dual use potential

also something about surveillance here

---

# plot

wir lernen: ADIs haben ein hive mind und koennen kooperieren

big twist: turns out, some guy does this because his girl friend got bullyied on social media and he wants to show people that bullying is bad

# minimal plot

* honey bees have died out
* they've been replaced by ADIs (autonomous drone insects)
* somehow, ADIs kill a person if their name & picture got shared under a hashtag on a twitter-like social media often enough
* turns out, some guy does this because his girl friend got bullyied on social media and he wants to show people that bullying is bad

---

# related tech

* facial recognition
really not as good as people say it was. cf Berlin Südkreuz, with "success" rates of about 75 % (resulting in hundreds of false positives for ONE true positive)

* 3D printing
ADIs build hives, hives reproduce ADIs (from what resources, though?)

* surveillance
ADIs have lots of sensors. government supposedly only backed the project provided they receive a back door so they could use the sensor data.
