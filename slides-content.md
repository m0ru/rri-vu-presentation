# Dual Use I

<blockquote> 
 …goods, software and technology that can be used for both civilian and military applications and/or can contribute to the proliferation of WMDs…
  </blockquote> 
<cite>European Commission, [15]</cite>

Note:
* what is civil, what is military? where/what is police work? if police is civil, then there are lots of technologies with harmful intents.
* what constitutes a  weapons of mass destruction (WMD) -- are the ADIs WMDs? [11]

---

# Dual Use II

<blockquote> 
  for military or other purposes with non-peaceful intents (…) like artificial intelligence and genetics which can be easily weaponised
</blockquote>
  <cite>Datta Burton et al. 2018a, p. 5</cite>
  
---

# Dual Use III

<blockquote> 
 does your research affect current standards in military ethics? Does your research involve the development of technologies or the creation of information that could have severe negative impacts on human rights standards (e.g. privacy, stigmatization, discrimination), if misapplied?
</blockquote>
  <cite>Datta Burton et al. 2018a, p. 23: 2014 version of checklist</cite>

Note:
* ethics checklist on DU is a requirement only for researchers who want their project to be funded by the EU?
* it's all about the trade-offs -- economy vs. personal security, surveillance, privacy, human rights, ...
* see also discussion about China having an advantage because they don't care about ethics "as much as Europe does" (which IMO is not much to begin with)

# Autonomous Drone Insects (ADIs)

![ADI on flower](./screenshots/adi-on-flower.PNG)
  
Note:
* artificial honey bee replacement
* used for pollination
* not controlled by a central server
*  self-replicating
* used civilly to prevent environmental catastrophe
* because honey bees have died out - and as we all know, no other insects pollinate, ever
* open question: do they produce honey? - img opportunity

---

## ADIs - Second use

funded by the government
  
have a backdoor for surveillance
  
government/secret service use them

Note:
* massive privacy invasion
* fast unmöglich, sich davor zu schützen, weil bees auch basically invisible sind
* unbekannt, welche und wie gute sensoren da sind
* klar, dass daten übertragen werden, z.B. videofeed und für positionsdaten (screenshot aus der folge)

* surveillance
ADIs have lots of sensors. government supposedly only backed the project provided they receive a back door so they could use the sensor data.

basic problem of backdoors: 

they can be used by third parties

---

## ADIs

![Nein! Doch! Ohhh!](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1d/f9/07/1df90734cdd17488be458d78a2e8caa6.gif)

Note: 
* security-diskussion entweder hier oder später mit anderen "improvements"

---

## Introduction: the plot

someone took over ADIs

and used them to kill people

controlled via unknown means 
(spoiler: they were hacked)

Note:
* honey bees have died out
* they've been replaced by ADIs (autonomous drone insects)

---

## Image Recognition

used by ADIs to find victims

dual use: 

helping you sort and find pictures

used for surveillance

Note:
anderes "tolles" dual-use example
side-rant über face-recognition
side-rant über mangelnde responsibility von researchern

* facial recognition
really not as good as people say it was. cf Berlin Südkreuz, with "success" rates of about 75 % (resulting in hundreds of false positives for ONE true positive)

---

## 3D Printing

ADIs are self-reproducing devices

dual use:

easily getting replacement parts

???

Note:
offensichtlich auch in militärischem Kontext nutzbar, weil was einen schraubenschlüssel printen kann, kann auch munition machen
ebenfalls dual-use, weil sowohl in civil als auch military contexts nutzbar

* 3D printing
ADIs build hives, hives reproduce ADIs (from what resources, though?)

---

# plot - target selection

targets are selected via pseudo twitter

recognised via uploaded image and image recognition

"the game of consequences"

Note:
* somehow, ADIs kill a person if their name & picture got shared under a hashtag on a twitter-like social media often enough

---

# Exkurs: Cyber Bullying

TODO: screenshot here [] (jo powers' twitter stream)

Note:
not part of the papers, but relevant here

ask whether game of consequences is a good way to deal with cyber bullying

---

# that big-ass database

TODO: text

Note:
intro. spielt nur als großes telefonbuch eine rolle, hat aber auch großes dual use potential -- reverse image lookup offensichtlich möglich!

also something about surveillance here

most unrealistic part: current, good-quality pics of everyone

---

# Back to: the plot

wir lernen: ADIs haben ein hive mind und koennen kooperieren

big twist: turns out, some guy does this because his girl friend got bullyied on social media and he wants to show people that bullying is bad

next victim found via pseudo twitter

bees can cooperate

TODO: screenshot here [] (bees cooperating to break down windows)
static: ![](https://thesnarkingdeadrecaps.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/bm-s3-e6-bee-attack.jpg?w=700&resize=700%2C322)
gif: ![](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjg3ZSFxYTfAhVD2aQKHcf2CkQQjRx6BAgBEAU&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgingesbecray.com%2Fblack-mirror-s3e06-hated-in-the-nation-recap%2F&psig=AOvVaw3xbJhpCkbgnMVssB2BpnJK&ust=1543956695394920)


Note:
* bees will cooperate
* bees are pretty much unkaputtbar
* some are more equal - abschalten wird erst diskutiert

---

# Kill switch

TODO: screenshot here [] (list of people who used #deathTo)

Note:
plot twist: game of consequences
erst aktiviert wenn bee-killswitch genutzt wird
actual victims sind menschen, die das Hashtag verwendet haben

* turns out, some guy does this because his girl friend got bullyied on social media and he wants to show people that bullying is bad

# Terror Tuesday

TODO: some notes about Terror Tuesday

# Drone killings

currently happening

close to episode, just smaller drones

<!--

death-lists
discussion of how that list is governed

# Recap - angesprochene Technologien

* Autonomous Drones
* Image Recognition
* 3D Printing
* Surveillance
* Cyber bullying
* Drone killings

# Potential Fixes

TODO: some GIF, because I can't think of useful text here

Note:
bees: can't really be made "hacking proof" - see discussion we've had
environmental conservation effort probably preferable
plus, there are other pollinating insects, we promise

dual use: only with increased ethical understanding of computer scientists, which is a whole other can of worms

other stuff

# Discussion Questions

What do you think about the "game of consequences"?

What is scarier: autonomous killer drones existing or being controlled by majority vote? <!-- not sure about this one; sthg related to how present-time killer drones are controlled -->

Where do you think the biggest fuck-up leading to this scenario happened?

Do you think using the ADIs for surveillance is defensible? What about that database?
